## Preface
A few weeks ago, I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) exam. The certificate is worth a lot to me and can help me go further in my career path since there is a trend for using cloud service to better maintain the company's application securely and costlessly. I highly recommend this exam for every cloud beginner since it would tell and illustrate how the cloud services work to achieve their purposes(ex: low latency, highly available, and so on). Don't worry, it's definitely related to the data science area that you and I are pursuing. Yes, I'm referring to the MLOps, deploying and maintaining machine learning models to production reliably and efficiently. Everything is relevant and works with each other, so don't be afraid to learn the cloud service!

Let's back to the topic of [multi-cloud](https://www.juniper.net/us/en/research-topics/what-is-multicloud.html#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20a%20multicloud%20could,stack%20on%20either%20public%20or). Before I took the intensive cloud training from [@thecloudbootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/@thecloudbootcamp). I think maybe it's enough to just specialize in a specific cloud service depending on the requirement of the company, such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and Oracle. However, a multi-cloud strategy can bring more flexibility for a company to select the best solution to meet its business need and requirement. In other words, multi-cloud is an expansion or upgraded version of one cloud platform service, which can provide higher availability and lower cost across multiple cloud hosting providers. Maybe I will not have a chance to apply all of the techniques used here in the future, but it can broaden my horizon and help me consider more when making decisions. In the end, I'm definitely not a professional in the cloud field but it's a good chance to start! 

Please don't worry about the expense of this project! You will not spend any money on this project! When signing up for new accounts of AWS and GCP, you will be on the free tier for AWS and have $300 credits for GCP to start your first cloud project. Sounds great? Let's start it! The cloud hosting providers and tools we will use are listed below:

- Cloud Platform: AWS, GCP
- Tools: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, GCR
- Data Storage: AWS S3
- Database: Google Cloud SQL

## Case Study - Define the problem
Thanks to intensive cloud training with real world case study information and data, we have the opportunity to use the most modern technologies and tools mentioned in practice to migrate real applications of luxury hotel chains to the cloud environment. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, hotels are required to keep testing records of customers' testing status to safely manage the hotel. The ever-increasing demand for network application traffic and data storage requires hotels to prepare more resources to deal with this situation. In this case, migrating the entire application and data to the cloud environment is a good solution, because the hotel does not have to worry about provisioning and managing instances and hardware itself, and the required resources can be scaled automatically based on demand. We will follow the instruction provided by the intensive cloud training step by step to understand the details of this project. I believe the real-world case does help us better understand how that knowledge and technologies were used in the market. Let's take a look at the solution architecture below: (You can also find the info of the project in the [link](https://thecloudbootcamp.com/en/pc-multicloud-event-icp2/?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=icp7-organic&utm_medium=linknadescricao&utm_content=cpl1&sck=&hl=).)
